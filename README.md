Catch Them All is a user-friendly web application I developed to assist musicians in expanding their fan base on Instagram while adhering to platform guidelines. This tool was born out of my personal need for a seamless and controlled approach to engaging with fans. Here's how it works:

-Creating a Profile:
Start by creating a profile on Catch Them All. This profile will differentiate your interactions and ensure personalized engagement with your audience.

-Uploading Instagram Profiles:
Upload a JSON file containing Instagram profiles that you want to interact with. The app allows you to load and manage profiles efficiently.

-Managing Interactions:
In the app's dashboard, you can view the profiles you've uploaded. Interact with them by adding or removing profiles from your list. The app allows you to manage up to 10 profiles at a time, ensuring controlled and gradual engagement.

-Setting Interaction Limits:
Catch Them All includes a counter system that limits your interactions to prevent your Instagram account from being flagged or banned. After a set number of actions, the app prevents you from doing more actions, in order to avoid any issues with Instagram's guidelines.

-Real-time Tracking and History:
Monitor your daily, weekly, and monthly interactions through the app's profile history feature. It provides insights into your engagement activities, allowing you to assess your progress.
